It includes a main C file (main.c) serving as the entry point for executable applications, along with a corresponding test file (test.c) for testing the application logic. The project also follows a convention for organizing reusable functions or libraries by creating a src directory, with example library files provided within it. The provided setup instructions include commands for compiling, running, and testing the program.",
